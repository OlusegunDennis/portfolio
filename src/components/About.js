      <p className="mt-4">
        I am a dedicated Quality Assurance and Software Tester with over three years of experience in ensuring the highest quality of software products. My proficiency spans both manual and automated testing, allowing me to contribute effectively to various stages of the software development lifecycle.

        In addition to my QA expertise, I have built this portfolio myself using React, which reflects my strong foundation in frontend development. I have hands-on experience in creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces, enhancing my ability to understand both the development and testing processes.

        I specialize in manual testing using tools like Postman for API testing, ensuring that applications meet functional requirements and provide seamless user experiences. My experience with JMeter allows me to conduct performance testing, ensuring that applications can handle expected loads efficiently.

        As an automation engineer, I leverage Cypress for end-to-end testing, integrating it into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins. My familiarity with version control systems like Git and Bitbucket enhances collaboration within teams, while my experience with Azure CI/CD ensures smooth deployment processes.

        I am well-versed in Agile methodologies and have actively participated in Scrum ceremonies, contributing to iterative development and continuous improvement. My skills extend to using JIRA for project management and bug tracking, as well as tools like BrowserStack for cross-browser testing.

        In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong foundation in SQL, which allows me to perform database testing and validate data integrity. I am committed to delivering high-quality software products through meticulous testing practices and a keen eye for detail.

        I believe that effective communication and collaboration are key to successful projects, and I strive to foster a positive team environment. I am passionate about staying updated with the latest testing trends and tools, continuously seeking opportunities to enhance my skill set.
